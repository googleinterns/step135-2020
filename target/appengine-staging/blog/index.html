        <h3>Summer 2020</h3>
        <h4>May 20th, 2020</h4>
        <p>
          This summer, outside of Google, I am hoping to:
          <ol>
            <li>Explore running (long-distance) and calisthenics</li>
            <li>Work on <a href="https://lambdaai.dev" target="_blank">Lambda AI</a>, 
                and formally release the product</li>
            <li>Read more (just read "The Happiness Advantage," 
                now I'm reading "How We Learn")</li>
          </ol>
        </p>

            <img class="gallery-image" alt="Person running" src="../images/running.jpg"/>
          </div>
          <div class="gallery-image-container">
            <img class="gallery-image" alt="Lambda AI Logo" 
              src="../images/lambda_ai_logo.jpeg"/>
          </div>
          <div class="gallery-image-container">
            <img class="gallery-image" alt="The Happiness Advantage Book Cover" 
              src="../images/happiness_advantage_book.jpg"/>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Given that I can't play tennis due to the quarantine, I 
          figured now is a good time to explore other options. 
          I like long-distance running more than sprints, and I usually 
          run for about thirty minutes every morning. 
          I hope to run the equivalent of a half-marathon soon, and  
          run around Mercer Island, which is about 13.5 miles 
          (I did 11 miles earlier in the year).
        </p>
        <p>
          I am also hoping to explore calisthenics more, especially 
          because we have a pull-up bar. Since this seems easy enough 
          to continue, whether I'm at home or elsewhere, the flexibility 
          lets me continue the routine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, I'm going to continue working on Lambda AI, and release 
          the product and see if we can get any customers. I don't have 
          a strict schedule for this, but we've finished creating the 
          "task widget" that can be embedded in place of ads, and a 
          backend which populates the tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, I want to continue reading, and potentially write down 
          what I learn. I finished reading <b>The Happiness Advantage</b>, 
          but I may re-read it and try to apply the principal concepts in 
          the book.
        </p>

          Thanks for reading the blog! :)
